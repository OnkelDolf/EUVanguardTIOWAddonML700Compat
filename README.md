# EUVanguardTIOWAddonML700Compat
A addon for the Arma 3 TIOW mod. This addon is based on Sabre One's Ace Compat Template since I was to lazy to create one my self.

What this addon does:
- Fixes a spelling mistake("[Cadian] Innfantry Backpack" is now "[Cadian] Infantry Backpack").
- Adds a Cadian Infantry AT Backpack which has double the space of the normal Cadian Infantry Backpack.
- Adds a High-Powered powerpack for the M36 Kantrael with double the damage but half the ammo capacity.
- Adds 100rnd and 150rnd versions of the heavy stubber mags.
- Increases the space of the Cadian Medicae Backpack and Cadian Medicae Backpack (Winter Camo) by 50%.
- Adds Vanguard Flak Armor that has a ~30% armor value increase over the normal Cadian Flak Armor.
- Adds Vanguard Medicae Flak Armor that has a ~30% armor value increase over the normal Cadian Medicae Flak Armor.
- Adds two Vanguard helmets. The normal helmet and the Hostile Eviroment version with a facemask. Both have a 125% armor value increase over the normal Cadian Helmets.
- Adds a [Vanguard] Unkown Pattern Las-LMG which is currently using the m36 model. Will get a model once it's finnished.
- Adds a 150rnd and 200rnd Las-LMG powerpack for the Las-LMG.
- Modifies the Type 14 and Hellgun powerpacks to be carriable. You can carry two with the Infantry AT Backpack
